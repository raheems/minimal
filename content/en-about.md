I am statistician by training with more than 15 years of experience in academia and industry combined. As a data scientist in clinical neurosciences, I work with clinicians and program directors and utilize machine learning algorithms to uncover information hidden in the massive amount of unprocessed healthcare data. 

I have over 10 years of experience in building predictive models utilizing statistical techniques to evaluate scenarios and to make predictions on future outcomes in order to solve complex business problems that support decision making.

As a subject matter expert, I provide strategic thoughts for the development, validation, and use of algorithms and statistical models in projects that involve multiple resources and tasks. 

[R](https://www.r-project.org/) is my analytic *lingua franca* and  [Python](https://www.python.org/) comes next. [SAS](https://www.sas.com) is the way to go for data management and standard statistical analysis so long I have access to it (through work).
