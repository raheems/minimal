My research is focused on building better predictive models through improved estimation of regression parameters. I am interested in the development and application of James-Stein type shrinkage estimation in parametric and semiparametric regression models and their comparisons with penalty estimators. In the event of a trade-off between bias and prediction error, James-Stein-type methods tend to achieve reduced overall prediction error that offsets the bias in the estimation.

Due to remarkable success in the reduction of childhood mortality by controlling infectious diseases in developing countries, thalassemias are likely to be a major public health concern in the coming decades in South Asia. Despite the fact that Bangladesh lies in the worldâ€™s thalassemia belt, the information on different aspects (epidemiology, clinical course, mortality, complications and treatment outcomes) of thalassemias is lacking.
