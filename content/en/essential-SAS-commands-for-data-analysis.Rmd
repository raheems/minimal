## Working with Date


## String Manipulation

### Remove characters from a string

Use the `COMPRESS` function to remove characters from the string.

```
data test;
x = "DC98699";
y = "C98374928345";

* Removing the alphabates from the x column;
x1 = compress(x, , "a");

# removing the alphabatest from y column;
y1 = compress(y, , 'a');
run;
```
