This is a chunk of R code

```{r}
# This is R code
x <- rnorm(100)
hist(x)
y <- rnorm(200)
plot(y)
```

## Now testing python code

```{python}
# Code in Python
import numpy as np
x = np.array(10)
print(x)
```

## Now trying code in SAS

```sas
# Code in SAS
# Highlights not showing
proc sql;
select * from a
quit;
```
